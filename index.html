    <p><b>Pakistan was established on August 14, 1947, as an independent nation for Muslims of the Indian subcontinent. The demand for a separate state was led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah and the All India Muslim League, culminating in the partition of British India. The country initially consisted of two regions: West Pakistan (present-day Pakistan) and East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). After years of political strife, East Pakistan became independent as Bangladesh in 1971. Pakistan has since navigated various challenges, including conflicts, political instability, and economic issues, but remains a key player in South Asia.</b></p>
